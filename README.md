```

Running `codilay` with no arguments opens the **Interactive Control Center**, a premium terminal-based dashboard that lets you manage projects, configurations, and audits without memorizing flags.

---

## 🛠 Features

### 🎮 Interactive Control Center (Terminal Dashboard)
Why use flags when you can have a full-blown dashboard in your terminal?
- **Project Switcher**: Quickly jump between documented codebases.
- **Provider Wizard**: Configure keys and models with real-time validation.
- **Live Monitoring**: Track active scans and resource usage.
- **Audit Console**: Launch security and architecture scans from a central menu.
- **History Browser**: View past conversations and export logs.
- **Smart Resume Detection**: When choosing "Document a codebase", CodiLay peeks at the existing state file and shows an incomplete-run banner with file counts before you confirm — so you know you're resuming, not starting fresh.

The **Tools & Automation** submenu (press `9`) now includes:
- **[12] Commit documentation** — interactive prompts to document the latest commit, a specific hash, the last N commits, a range, or the full repo history (with optional metrics).
- **[13] Git hooks** — install or remove the post-commit hook that auto-generates commit docs in the background after every `git commit`.

### 🧠 The Wire Model
CodiLay treats every import, function call, and variable reference as a **Wire**. 
- **Open Wires**: Unresolved references that the agent is "hunting" for.
- **Closed Wires**: Successfully traced connections that form segments of the dependency graph.

### ⚡️ Smart Triage
Before burning tokens, CodiLay performs a high-speed **Triage Phase**. It classifies files into:
- **Core**: Full architectural analysis and documentation.
- **Skim**: Metadata and signatures only (saves tokens on simple utilities).
- **Skip**: Ignores boilerplate, generated code, and platform-specific noise.

### 🔄 Git-Aware Incremental Updates
CodiLay is repo-aware. If you've only changed 2 files in a 500-file project, `codilay .` will:
1. Detect the delta via Git.
2. Invalidate only the affected documentation sections.
3. Re-open wires related to the changed code.
4. Re-calculate the local impact to keep your `CODEBASE.md` current.

### 💬 Interactive Chat & Memory
Ask questions about your codebase using `codilay chat .`.
- **RAG + Deep Search**: It uses your documentation for fast answers but can "escalate" to reading source code for implementation details.
- **Memory**: The agent remembers your preferences and facts about the codebase across sessions.
- **Promote to Doc**: Found a great explanation in chat? Use `/promote` to turn the AI's answer into a permanent section of your documentation.

#### 🌿 Conversation Tree — Branching on Edit
Conversations are a **tree**, not a list. Every message is a node; editing a past message creates a new branch from that point while fully preserving the original thread. You can navigate, compare, and continue any branch independently.

```
msg_001  "How does the payment service work?"
msg_002  "The payment service handles..."
msg_003  "What about retries?"
    │
    ├── main branch (original)
    │   msg_004  "Retries use exponential backoff..."
    │   msg_005  "How long are the delays?"
    │
    └── webhooks branch (created by editing msg_003)
        msg_006  "Retries are separate from webhooks..."
        msg_007  "Where are webhooks handled?"
```

The LLM context for each branch only includes its own ancestry — edits on a sibling branch are invisible. Old conversations are migrated automatically on first read.

#### 🔒 Private & Team Workspaces
Every conversation has a **visibility** setting:

| Visibility | Who sees it |
|:---|:---|
| `private` | Only the conversation owner |
| `team` | All team members |

The Web UI history sidebar splits conversations into **Private** and **Team** sections. Set your username once (stored in the browser) and the filter applies automatically. A conversation can start private and be promoted to team-visible at any time.

```bash
codilay serve .
```

- **Layer 1: The Reader**: High-fidelity rendering of your sections and graph.
- **Layer 2: The Chatbot**: Quick Q&A from documented context — with branch-aware history (only the active branch's messages are sent to the LLM).
- **Layer 3: The Deep Agent**: Reaches into source code to verify facts.
- **Layer 4: Audit Lab**: Browse past audit reports and run new ones directly from the web interface.
- **Commits tab**: Browse all commit docs, generate new ones (with optional context and metrics), and read full docs with visual quality score bars.

**Branch navigation in the Web UI:**
- An **Edit** button appears on hover over any past user message — clicking it opens an inline textarea; submitting creates a new branch.
- A **branch indicator button** in the chat toolbar shows the active branch name and total count; clicking it opens a switcher to jump between branches.
- The **history dropdown** groups conversations by Private and Team, shows branch count per conversation, and lets you set/change your username.

### 👁 Watch Mode & Real-time Progress
Run CodiLay in the background and automatically update documentation when files change. 
- **Debounced Watcher**: Uses filesystem events (via watchdog) to auto-update on save.
- **Real-time Progress Display**: High-resolution progress bars for file processing, triage, and LLM calls.
- **Eager Resolution**: Wires are closed the moment a file is processed, giving you instant graph feedback.

```bash
# Watch the current directory, auto-update on save
codilay watch .

# Custom debounce delay (5 seconds)
codilay watch . --debounce 5

# Verbose output for debugging
codilay watch . -v
```

### 🧩 IDE Integration (VSCode Extension)
A VSCode extension that surfaces documentation inline alongside the file you're editing. Features include:
- **Sidebar tree view** of all documented sections
- **Webview panel** showing full documentation for the active file
- **Inline decorations** highlighting documented symbols
- **Quick commands** for asking questions, viewing the graph, and searching conversations

Install from `vscode-extension/` directory — see the extension README for details.

### 🤖 Interactive AI Context Export
Export your documentation in a precise, token-efficient format tailored for LLM context windows. CodiLay supports **LLM-guided customization**, allowing you to describe exactly what you need in natural language.

#### 💬 Interactive Mode
Launch a conversational interface to define your export specification. The agent will translate your needs into a spec, estimate tokens, and show you a plan before committing.
```bash
codilay export . --interactive
```

#### ⚡️ Query Mode
Provide a natural language description directly from the CLI for a one-shot export.
```bash
# Just the file structure and linkage
codilay export . --query "file structure and linkage only" -o structure.md

# API surface and schemas
codilay export . --query "just the API endpoints and their schemas" -o api.md
```

#### 📋 Preset Mode
Use pre-configured templates or your own custom presets for common tasks.
```bash
# List available presets (structure, api-surface, onboarding, etc.)
codilay export . --list-presets

# Use the 'architecture' preset
codilay export . --preset architecture -o context.md
```

#### ✂️ Implementation Stripping
When using interactive or query modes, CodiLay can automatically **strip implementation details** (function bodies, internal logic) while keeping signatures and documentation headers, drastically reducing token usage without losing architectural context.

### 📊 Documentation Diff
See a section-by-section changelog of what shifted in your documentation between runs. Unlike `codilay diff` (which shows git-level file changes), `diff-doc` compares the actual documentation content.

```bash
# Show what changed in the docs since the last run
codilay diff-doc .

# Output as JSON for programmatic use
codilay diff-doc . --json-output
```

Snapshots are saved automatically after every `codilay run`, so diffs are always available.

### 📝 Diff-Run — Document Changes Only
Generate focused documentation for code changes since a specific boundary instead of analyzing the entire codebase. Perfect for feature branches, pull requests, and incremental updates.

**Boundary Types:**
- **Commit hash**: `--since abc123f`
- **Git tag**: `--since v2.1.0`
- **Date**: `--since 2024-03-01` (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Branch**: `--since-branch main` (uses merge-base for comparison)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Document changes since a specific commit
codilay diff-run . --since abc123f

# Document all changes since a release tag
codilay diff-run . --since v2.1.0

# Document changes since last month
codilay diff-run . --since 2024-03-01

# Document changes on a feature branch (vs main)
codilay diff-run . --since-branch main

# Update CODEBASE.md with change analysis
codilay diff-run . --since-branch main --update-doc
```

**What You Get:**
- **Change Summary**: AI-generated overview of what changed and why it matters
- **Added/Modified/Deleted Files**: Detailed impact analysis for each change
- **Wire Impact Report**: Dependencies introduced, satisfied, or broken
- **Affected Documentation Sections**: Which existing docs may need updating
- **Commit Context**: All commits included in the diff for reference

The report is saved as `CHANGES_{boundary_type}_{timestamp}.md` in your codilay output directory, making it easy to track documentation changes alongside code changes.

### 🎯 Triage Tuning
Flag incorrect triage decisions to improve future runs. Corrections are stored per-project and automatically applied during the triage phase of subsequent runs.

```bash
# Flag a file that was skimmed but should be core
codilay triage-feedback add . src/auth/handler.py skim core -r "Contains critical auth logic"

# Flag a pattern (glob-based)
codilay triage-feedback add . "tests/**" core skip --pattern -r "Tests should be skipped"

# List all stored feedback
codilay triage-feedback list .

# Set a hint for a project type
codilay triage-feedback hint . react "Treat all hooks/ files as core"

# Remove feedback for a specific file
codilay triage-feedback remove . src/auth/handler.py

# Clear all feedback
codilay triage-feedback clear . --yes
```

### 🔍 Graph Filters
Filter the dependency graph by wire type, file layer, module, or connection count. Essential for reducing noise on large repositories.

```bash
# Show only import-type wires
codilay graph . --wire-type import

# Filter to a specific directory layer
codilay graph . --layer src/api

# Show only nodes with 3+ connections, outgoing edges only
codilay graph . --min-connections 3 --direction outgoing

# Combine filters, exclude tests
codilay graph . -w import -l src/core -x "tests/**"

# List available filter values for a project
codilay graph . --list-filters

# Output as JSON
codilay graph . --json-output
```

### 🧠 Team Memory
A shared knowledge base for teams working on the same project. Record facts, architectural decisions, coding conventions, and file annotations — all stored per-project and surfaced to the AI during documentation and chat.

```bash
# Add a team member
codilay team add-user . alice --display-name "Alice Chen"

# Record a fact
codilay team add-fact . "We use Celery for async tasks" -c architecture -a alice -t backend -t infra

# Vote on a fact
codilay team vote . <fact-id> up

# Record an architectural decision
codilay team add-decision . "Use PostgreSQL over MySQL" "Better JSON support, needed for our schema" -a alice -f src/db/

# Add a coding convention
codilay team add-convention . "Error Handling" "All API endpoints must return structured error responses" -e '{"error": "message", "code": 400}' -a alice

# Annotate a specific file
codilay team annotate . src/api/routes.py "This file is getting too large, plan to split by domain" -a alice -l 1-50

# List everything
codilay team facts .                   # All facts
codilay team facts . -c architecture   # Facts by category
codilay team decisions .               # All decisions
codilay team decisions . -s active     # Active decisions only
codilay team conventions .             # All conventions
codilay team annotations .             # All annotations
codilay team annotations . -f src/api/routes.py  # Per-file
codilay team users .                   # All members
```

### 🔎 Conversation Search
Full-text search across all past chat conversations — not just the current session. Uses an inverted index with TF-IDF scoring for fast, relevant results.

```bash
# Search all conversations
codilay search . "authentication flow"

# Top 5 results, assistant messages only
codilay search . "error handling" --top 5 --role assistant

# Search within a specific conversation
codilay search . "database migration" -c <conversation-id>

# Rebuild the index (after manual edits to chat files)
codilay search . "query" --rebuild
```

### 📅 Scheduled Re-runs
Automatically trigger documentation updates on a cron schedule or when new commits land on a branch. Runs as a background daemon with PID file management.

```bash
# Update docs every day at 2am
codilay schedule set . --cron "0 2 * * *"

# Update on every new commit to main
codilay schedule set . --on-commit --branch main

# Combine: cron + commit triggers
codilay schedule set . --cron "0 2 * * *" --on-commit

# Check current schedule
codilay schedule status .

# Start the scheduler (foreground)
codilay schedule start .

# Start with verbose logging
codilay schedule start . -v

# Stop a running scheduler
codilay schedule stop .

# Disable the schedule
codilay schedule disable .
```

### ✍️ Code Annotation
Write documentation back into your source files — not just into `CODEBASE.md`. CodiLay uses its wire knowledge to annotate every function with what calls it, what it calls, and why it exists.

```bash
# Preview what would be added (no writes)
codilay annotate . --dry-run

# Annotate the whole project (docstrings only)
codilay annotate .

# Annotate a specific folder with full inline comments
codilay annotate . --scope src/payments/ --level full

# Annotate with JSDoc / GoDoc / DartDoc / Rust doc comments too
codilay annotate . --scope src/api/

# Undo a previous annotation run
codilay annotate . --rollback 20240314_120000
```

**Annotation levels:**

| Level | What gets added |
|:---|:---|
| `docstrings` | Function/class docstrings only (default) |
| `inline` | Inline comments on non-obvious lines only |
| `full` | Both docstrings and inline comments |

**Language-aware comment styles:**
- Python → `"""triple-quoted docstrings"""`
- JavaScript / TypeScript → `/** JSDoc */`
- Go → `// GoDoc above functions`
- Rust → `/// triple-slash doc comments`
- Dart → `/// DartDoc comments`
- Java / Kotlin / C# → `/** Javadoc */`

**Wire connection block** (unique to CodiLay — no other tool writes this):
```python
def process_payment(order_id, retry_count=0):
    """
    Charges the customer for a pending order via Stripe.

    Wire connections:
      ← Called by: routes/orders.py, scheduler/retry_jobs.py
      → Calls:     stripe.charge.create, notify_fulfillment (async)
      → Reads:     Order, Customer (models)

    Retry logic: up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff (60s, 120s, 180s).
    """
```

**Safety guards** (all configurable in global settings):
- Requires a clean git working tree by default — easy rollback with `git checkout .`
- `--dry-run` always available before committing to writes
- Per-file syntax validation (Python `ast.parse`) before any write
- Automatic backup to `codilay/annotation_history/` for rollback without git

### 🔒 Resilience & Recovery

CodiLay is designed to survive interruptions without losing money or progress.

**State backups** — after every file processed, the state file is saved atomically. Three rolling backups (`.bak.1`, `.bak.2`, `.bak.3`) are kept alongside it. If the primary state is corrupt on the next startup, CodiLay automatically falls back to the most recent valid backup.

**Resume from any interruption** — whether Ctrl+C, a crash, or an API auth failure, the run can always be resumed from the last checkpoint. The interactive menu previews how many files were saved and how many remain before you confirm:

```
┌─ Incomplete Run Found ─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  • Processed:    48 files saved                            │
│  • Remaining:    25 files to go                            │
│  • Total planned: 73 files                                 │
│                                                            │
│  Resuming costs nothing for already-documented files.      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Concurrent run prevention** — a lock file prevents two `codilay` processes from running on the same project simultaneously. Stale locks from crashed runs are cleaned up automatically via PID validation.

**Cost estimation before processing** — after planning, CodiLay prints a rough cost estimate before spending any tokens:
```
ℹ  Estimated cost for 73 files: $0.33  (rough — actual varies by file size and model)
```

**Auth errors pause, not crash** — if an API key expires mid-run, the run pauses with the checkpoint saved. Fix the key with `codilay keys`, then resume exactly where it stopped.

**Error panel at end of run** — every skip, warning, and failure is collected during the run and displayed in a structured panel when it completes:
```
┌─ Run Issues — 1 warning  2 skipped ────────────────────────┐
│  WARNING  src/services/payment.py                          │
│    What:   Failed to process                               │
│    Why:    LLM returned empty response after 3 retries     │
│    Action: File parked — run continued without it          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 📋 Commit Documentation

Every commit tells a story — but commit messages are usually too terse to explain *why* a file was touched, what downstream effects a change has, or what a reviewer should pay close attention to. Commit docs fix that.

CodiLay reads the git diff for any commit and writes a plain-language document explaining what changed in each file and why it matters. Optionally, it runs a second pass to score the diff across five quality dimensions.

```bash
# Document the last commit
codilay commit-doc

# Document a specific commit
codilay commit-doc abc123f

# Document all commits on a branch
codilay commit-doc --range main..HEAD

# Include relevant CODEBASE.md sections for downstream context
codilay commit-doc --context

# Append quality metrics analysis
codilay commit-doc --metrics

# Everything together
codilay commit-doc abc123f --context --metrics
```

**What each doc contains:**
- Plain-language summary of what changed overall
- Per-file explanation of what that file's change actually does (not a diff restatement)

**With `--metrics`**, a second LLM pass scores the diff across five dimensions:

| Metric | What it measures |
|:---|:---|
| Code Quality | Readability, naming, visible code smells in changed lines |
| Test Coverage | Ratio of test additions to logic additions (-1 = N/A for non-testable files) |
| Security | Red flags in the diff — hardcoded secrets, injection risks, unsafe ops |
| Complexity | Delta only — did the change make code more or less complex? |
| Documentation | Were comments/docstrings added for the new logic? |

Each metric is scored 0–10 with a one-line note and optional reviewer warnings for things worth a closer look.

Docs are saved to `codilay/commit-docs/<hash>.md` — gitignored by default, easy to commit if the team wants them.

**Backfill historical commits** — document your entire git history (or a slice of it) in one shot:

```bash
# Document every commit in the repo
codilay commit-doc --all

# Document the last 20 commits
codilay commit-doc --last 20

# Document a specific range (inclusive of both ends)
codilay commit-doc --from abc123f --to def456a

# Filter by author or path
codilay commit-doc --all --author "alice" --path "src/auth"

# Add metrics to every commit
codilay commit-doc --last 50 --metrics

# Skip the cost preview and run immediately
codilay commit-doc --all --yes

# Parallelism (default: 4 workers)
codilay commit-doc --all --workers 8

# Re-process commits that already have docs
codilay commit-doc --all --force

# Only add metrics to commits that are documented but lack them
codilay commit-doc --all --force-metrics
```

Backfill shows a cost preview before running (estimated at ~$0.01/commit, ~$0.02 with `--metrics`) and prompts `[c]ontinue / [f]orce / [q]uit`. Already-documented commits are skipped automatically — safe to re-run at any time. After backfill completes, `codilay/commit-docs/index.md` is updated with a full changelog.

**Auto-generate on every commit** with a post-commit git hook:

```bash
# Install the hook (appends to existing hooks safely)
codilay hooks install . --commit-doc

# Remove it
codilay hooks uninstall . --commit-doc
```

The hook runs `codilay commit-doc` silently in the background after each commit — zero friction for the developer.

**Browsable in the Web UI** — the **Commits** tab shows all generated docs as cards (hash, date, commit message), click any to read the full doc with visual score bars for metrics. The backfill controls are also available directly from the UI.

### 🛡️ System Audits (Architecture & Security)
Run AI-powered audits against your architecture, security, performance, and code quality. Passive mode uses existing context (fast), while active mode deeply inspects files (thorough). 

CodiLay supports **60+ different audit types**, including:
- **Security**: XSS, Auth flows, Secrets, Crypto, Container/Cloud security, Pentest.
- **Architecture**: Scalability, Caching, DB Efficiency, API Boundaries.
- **Quality**: Readability, Chaos Engineering, Reliability, SEO.
- **Compliance**: GDPR, License violations, Data Governance.

```bash
# Run a passive security audit
codilay audit . --type security --mode passive

# Run an active architecture audit
codilay audit . --type architecture --mode active
```
Audits can be managed and viewed from the **CLI**, the **Interactive Menu**, or the **Web UI**.

### 📋 Configuration Fields

| Category | Key | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **General** | `ignore` | `List[str]` | Glob patterns for files/folders to exclude from scans. |
| | `notes` | `str` | High-level project context provided to the AI. |
| | `instructions` | `str` | Specific documentation style or domain instructions. |
| | `entryHint` | `str` | Point to the main entry file to help trace wires. |
| | `skipGenerated` | `List[str]` | Optional override for default generated/lock file ignores. |
| **LLM** | `provider` | `str` | AI provider (e.g., `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `ollama`). |
| | `model` | `str` | Model identifier (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`). |
| | `baseUrl` | `str` | Custom API base URL (useful for local models or proxies). |
| | `maxTokensPerCall`| `int` | Maximum output tokens per individual agent call. |
| **Triage** | `mode` | `str` | Default classification strategy (`smart`, `core`, `skim`, `skip`). |
| | `includeTests` | `bool` | Whether to process test files (defaults to `false`). |
| | `forceInclude` | `List[str]` | Patterns to always treat as **Core** documentation. |
| | `forceSkip` | `List[str]` | Patterns to always ignore. |
| **Chunking** | `tokenThreshold` | `int` | Files larger than this (in tokens) are split into chunks. |
| | `maxChunkTokens` | `int` | Target token count for each detail chunk. |
| | `overlapRatio` | `float` | Contextual overlap between chunks (e.g. `0.10` for 10%). |
| **Parallel** | `enabled` | `bool` | Enable/disable concurrent processing of files within the same tier. |
| | `maxWorkers` | `int` | Max number of concurrent LLM calls. |

### 🌍 Multi-Provider Support
CodiLay is provider-agnostic. Power it with:
- **Cloud**: Anthropic (claude-opus-4-6, claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-haiku-4-5), OpenAI (gpt-4o, o3, o4-mini), Google Gemini (2.0 Flash, 2.5 Pro).
- **Local**: Ollama, Groq, Llama Cloud (Llama 4).
- **Specialty**: DeepSeek (including deepseek-reasoner), Mistral, xAI (Grok).
- **Custom**: Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

**Model presets** — the interactive menu now shows a numbered list of known models per provider rather than a free-form text field. Models that support extended thinking / reasoning are marked with ✦.

**Reasoning / Extended Thinking** — enable deeper analysis for supporting models. Configure via `codilay` → Preferences → LLM & API → Reasoning:
- **Anthropic** (claude-opus-4-6, claude-sonnet-4-6 ✦): extended thinking with configurable token budget
- **OpenAI** (o3, o4-mini ✦): reasoning effort (`low` / `medium` / `high`)
- Choose which operations use reasoning: `processing`, `planning`, `deep_agent`
